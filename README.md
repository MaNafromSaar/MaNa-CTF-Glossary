## 🌟 Features

- **Tag-based organization**: No rigid categories, search across all related tags
- **Multiple views**: Table, card, and alphabetical formats for easy reference
- **Searchable**: Full text search across all entries and tags
- **Responsive design**: Works on mobile and desktop devices
- **Multiple resource and tool links**: Each entry can have multiple reference links and related tools
- **Easy contribution**: Simple JSON-based storage for community contributions

## 📚 Using the Glossary

The glossary has three different views:

1. **Table View**: Default view with all terms in a table format. Best for quickly scanning many entries.
2. **Card View**: Visual card-based layout for each term. Provides a more detailed view of each entry.
3. **A-Z View**: Traditional alphabetical organization with entries grouped by first letter. Ideal for browsing the glossary like a dictionary.

### Tag Filtering

You can filter the glossary by clicking on tags in the tag filter section at the top of the page. Multiple tag selection filters for entries that contain ALL selected tags.

### Search Functionality

The search box allows you to quickly find terms by searching across:
- Term names
- Descriptions
- Tags
- Resources

## 🛠️ Adding New Entries

### Quick Start

Get started quickly with the setup script:

```bash
cd glossary
./setup.sh
```

This will ensure all scripts are executable and ready to use.

### Using the Interactive Manager (Recommended)

The easiest way to manage the glossary is using the included Python manager script:

```bash
cd glossary
./glossary.py
```

This interactive tool provides a simple menu system to:
- Add new entries
- Edit existing entries
- Delete entries
- Search for terms
- Export to HTML
- List all entries

### Command-Line Usage

You can also use direct commands for quick operations:

```bash
# Add a new entry
./glossary.py add

# Edit an entry (will prompt for which one or search)
./glossary.py edit

# Search for terms
./glossary.py search exploit

# Generate HTML output
./glossary.py export

# List all entries
./glossary.py list

# Display help
./glossary.py help
```

### Manual Editing (Recommended)

To add entries directly, open `glossary_data.json` in your editor. For consistency and to avoid errors, use the provided template in `glossary_entry_template.json`:

- Copy the contents of `glossary_entry_template.json` as a starting point for new entries.
- Place new entries in alphabetical order by the `term` field.
- For tools, include the `flags` array and relevant online resources.
- For terminology, use clear tags and at least one resource if possible.
- The `letter` field should be the first letter of the term (A-Z, 0-9, or special).

### Using the Python Scripts

You can also use the provided Python scripts for interactive entry management:

```sh
python3 add_entry.py
python3 glossary_manager.py
```
